## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- **`fact-consolidate-worker` had no single-instance lock** — the SessionStart hook
  spawns it detached on every session with no lock, so orphaned workers (ppid=1) piled
  up (measured 14 at once), each spawning a headless Claude session per LLM call and
  flooding the proxy across the account pool. Added a GLOBAL atomic `wx` pid-lock (same
  pattern as the ontology/extract/reembed workers). The lock is global, not per-project,
  because consolidation touches shared global-scope facts — concurrent per-project
  workers would race on the same rows.
- **Consolidation now processes the whole backlog in one pass** (`consolidateAllPending`
  / `getAllNewFactsSince`): the single lock-holder walks every new fact across all
  scopes/projects exactly once under a single Haiku budget, instead of looping
  `consolidateFacts` per project — which re-examined shared global facts once per project
  (up to `MAX_HAIKU_CALLS × projectCount` calls, since INDEPENDENT/CONTRADICTION verdicts
  keep the fact active) and could starve a project whose only pending work was an old
  fact matching a new global one. Same orphan-flood class fixed for the backfill workers
  in v1.3.0; the consolidate worker was the last detached worker missing a lock.
- **Same-scope-only consolidation** (`searchSimilarFactsSameScope`): a fact is compared
  ONLY within its own scope — a project fact against its own project's facts, a global
  fact against other global facts — with the scope gate applied to the full candidate
  overfetch BEFORE truncation, so an in-scope match is never starved out by closer
  out-of-scope rows. This closes a cross-scope data-leak/mutation path in both directions:
  a global driver reaching into a project's private rows, AND a project-private driver
  rewriting a shared global fact via EVOLUTION (leaking private text to every project) or
  deactivating it via CONTRADICTION. The old per-project `consolidateFacts()` (which used
  a project-scoped search that still included globals) was removed — all consolidation
  now goes through the single-pass, scope-isolated `consolidateAllPending`. The
  same-scope search pages the KNN fetch (growing until enough in-scope hits or the
  whole index is scanned) so even >200 closer out-of-scope rows cannot hide a valid
  in-scope match. `consolidateFacts` is kept as a deprecated, now-scope-safe back-compat
  export so existing importers don't crash at module load.
- **Unparseable comparison output is a no-op, not a hard stop**: consolidation is a
  best-effort background dedup, so a comparison whose LLM output isn't valid JSON is
  treated as "no verdict" and the cursor advances past it (the call still counts against
  the per-run Haiku budget). The pair is not lost — both facts stay active and the
  comparison re-triggers whenever either is a driver/candidate later — and no single fact
  (a transient non-JSON response, or a deliberately crafted one) can hold the cursor and
  starve the rest of the backlog. Only TRANSIENT call failures (callHaiku rejected — infra
  down) hold the cursor to retry, which is safe because during an outage nothing else
  would progress either.
- **Keyset consolidation cursor `(created_at, id)`**: the progress cursor was keyed on
  `created_at` alone, which stalled forever when a single timestamp group held more facts
  than the per-run Haiku budget (the cursor couldn't advance into a shared timestamp
  without risking a skip, so every run reprocessed the same oldest N and never reached the
  rest of the backlog). Keying on the unique `(created_at, id)` pair lets the drain advance
  one fact at a time — no stall, no same-timestamp skip. The cursor is persisted as JSON;
  an absent/legacy/corrupt cursor makes the drain start from the BEGINNING (no active fact
  is skipped — the per-run budget only caps actual consolidation calls, so the whole
  backlog drains across a few runs regardless of age). A fact imported mid-drain with an
  old timestamp is not re-driven by the current pass but is still a candidate for future
  comparisons (best-effort dedup, documented).
- **Bounded drain page + index**: the consolidation query pages the keyset (LIMIT 2000)
  instead of materializing every active fact, and a new `idx_facts_active_created_id`
  index serves the `(is_active, created_at, id)` filter+sort — so a from-the-beginning
  drain over tens of thousands of facts can't OOM or trigger a full-table temp sort.
- **Error-classified consolidation failure handling** (`classifyLlmError`): a comparison
  CALL rejection is three-valued — TRANSIENT (429/5xx/timeout/network/auth), DETERMINISTIC
  (400/413/422/oversized-prompt), or UNKNOWN (unrecognized). The status is read from the
  structured error (`status`/`statusCode`) OR the nested SDK/axios shape
  (`error.response.status`) OR a status number explicitly labelled in the message
  ("status code 400") — never a bare incidental number ("retry after 400 ms"). The drain
  loop SKIPS (advances after `facts.consolidation_attempts` reaches MAX, idempotent
  migration) **only** on a recognized DETERMINISTIC rejection — the one case where the fact
  itself is provably at fault. TRANSIENT, UNKNOWN, and any non-LLM internal error
  (parser/DB bug, tagged apart via `LlmCallError`) all HOLD the cursor and retry — an
  outage or an unrecognized error never silently drains the backlog, and a code bug never
  gets miscounted as a "bad fact". Skipping only on a certain per-request rejection is the
  narrowest, safest criterion that satisfies both "an outage must not silently drain the
  backlog" and "one un-processable fact must not wedge the cursor".
- **Persisted consolidation cursor**: the worker records the last fully-examined
  `created_at` (`fact-consolidate-cursor.txt`) and resumes after it, so the single Haiku
  budget reaches newer/project backlog instead of re-spending every run on the same
  oldest INDEPENDENT facts. The cursor only advances past a timestamp strictly older than
  the first unexamined fact, so same-millisecond facts at the budget wall are never
  skipped; a fact whose comparison errors (transient LLM failure) also holds the cursor
  back so it is retried, not permanently skipped.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-05

### Documentation
- **README**: "What's New" refreshed for v1.3.0 (batch classification, spawn isolation,
  attempt ledger, vec-index self-heal, hardened worker caps) and new **Configuration**
  entries for the backfill worker env knobs (`BACKFILL_ONTOLOGY_MAX`, `BACKFILL_EXTRACT_MAX`,
  `BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE`, `BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY`, `BACKFILL_RELATIONS`) and the opt-in
  deterministic reuse gate (`MEMORY_BANK_ONTOLOGY_DET_GATE`, disabled by default per
  live measurement)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- **Ontology backfill batching**: `backfill-ontology-worker` now classifies facts in
  batches (default 20 per LLM call, `BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE` env, ceiling 50) — one
  headless Agent SDK spawn per batch instead of per fact. Measured on live data:
  40 facts in 19s vs ~8min with per-fact calls (~25× wall-clock, 20× fewer spawns).
- **Headless LLM spawn isolation** (`llm.ts`): Agent SDK sessions now run with
  `maxTurns: 1`, `settingSources: []`, and a dedicated tmp `cwd` — worker LLM calls
  no longer fire user SessionStart/End hooks (which re-spawned sync/backfill workers
  per call) and no longer drop transcripts into user project dirs (where
  `claude --resume` could pick up a worker session).
- **Backfill relation detection defaults OFF** (`BACKFILL_RELATIONS=1` to opt in):
  each relation probe costs an extra LLM call; insert-time detection is unchanged.

### Added
- **Ontology attempt ledger** (`facts.ontology_attempts` / `ontology_last_attempt_at`,
  idempotent migration): failed classifications are counted per fact; after
  3 attempts the fact is parked in General/Misc and permanently leaves the backfill
  queue (it stays fully searchable — ontology is an overlay). Ends the
  re-select-and-re-bill-forever loop for permanently failing facts.
- `scripts/measure-det-gate.mjs` — live-data measurement harness for the
  deterministic category-reuse gate. The gate ships DISABLED by default
  (opt-in via `MEMORY_BANK_ONTOLOGY_DET_GATE`): measured top-1 agreement with LLM
  assignments was only 72% at sim≥0.93 (n=800 sample) — insufficient for auto-assign.

### Hardened (adversarial review, 24 rounds pre-release)
- Single-fact classification path unified onto the batch core (structured JSON prompt,
  index validation, typed failure taxonomy shared)
- Transient circuit breaker in the backfill worker (consecutive all-transient batches
  abort the run; facts preserved untouched)
- Category vec-index self-heal: exact id set-diff trigger, bidirectional reconciliation
  (add missing + purge stale), structured completeness reporting — an incomplete index
  always refuses candidate-starved classification
- `IndexRepairError` typed escalation: index corruption surfaces loudly, never burns
  fact attempts, never blocks relation detection over the healthy fact index
- Relation edges idempotent per (source, type, target) + UNIQUE index migration
  (exact-triple dedup only — distinct relation types between the same facts are
  preserved as valid graph data)
- Graph traversal: deterministic belief-safety edge preference (CONTRADICTS >
  SUPERSEDES > affirmative), qualifying-edge fallback, and pruned-path containment

### Fixed
- **Fallback classification was never persisted**: on unparseable LLM output the
  classifier built General/Misc but returned without writing the fact's
  `ontology_category_id`, leaving it NULL — re-selected (and re-billed) by every
  backfill run. Classification failure now raises, feeds the attempt ledger, and
  the fallback is actually persisted at the attempt cap.
- **Honest failure counts** in the backfill log: errors were swallowed inside
  `classifyAndLinkFact`, so the log always reported `failed 0`. The batch pipeline
  reports llm/deterministic/fallback/failed separately.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-04

### Documentation
- **README**: "What's New" refreshed for v1.2.x, new **Context Injection** section
  (per-prompt injection pipeline, baseline-margin relevance gate, 1-hop ontology
  expansion, observability log locations, troubleshooting), Context Injection
  added to the feature list and data-flow diagram.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Injection observability (fail-loud)**: the UserPromptSubmit context-injection
  pipeline now records every run as a JSONL entry
  (`<config>/conversation-index/logs/inject-context.jsonl` — status
  injected/no-match/skipped/error, candidate/injected counts, duration), and the
  hook wrapper routes node-level crash output to `logs/inject-context.err.log`
  instead of discarding it. A silently broken install (stale plugin, missing
  `node_modules`) is now measurable instead of invisible — the previous
  silent-failure mode went unnoticed for months.

### Fixed
- Injection error paths now log the failure reason (truncated to 300 chars)
  alongside the existing stderr message.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **`memory-bank analyze` command**: Deterministic full-history analysis of the entire
  conversation index — coverage (fact extraction / summaries), fact breakdowns by
  category/scope, top knowledge domains, per-project rollups, monthly activity
  timeline, and backfill recommendations. Supports `--json`, `--out`, `--top`, `--months`.
- **`analyzing-all-conversations` skill**: Plugin skill that runs the analyze engine,
  kicks off backfill for unanalyzed sessions, enriches the numbers with fact/ontology
  search, and presents an organized report of the whole conversation history.
- **Transparent `.zst` archive support** (`src/archive-io.ts`): The conversation archive
  may be compressed out-of-band (`*.jsonl` → `*.jsonl.zst`). All read paths — parser,
  `read` MCP tool, search summaries/line counts, sync, stats, indexer, verify — now
  resolve either variant using Node's built-in zstd (Node >= 22.15), no new dependency.

### Changed
- **FTS5 text search**: BM25-ranked full-text search (`exchanges_fts`, detail=column) replaces
  the O(rows) LIKE full scan — recall@10 0.93 → 1.00, FTS index 2,953MB → 407MB. Query
  tokenization aligned with the unicode61 tokenizer; identifier tokens preserved; rank
  budget + sparse-token AND ladder to avoid BM25 pathologies.
- **Search-path performance**: cached search DB connection (path-keyed, mtime-checked),
  int8 vector quantization for `vec_exchanges` (dual-dtype with migration), and
  query-embedding LRU memoization (removes double embedding per MCP search).
- **Backfill extraction guards**: self-referential projects excluded by default
  (`BACKFILL_EXCLUDE_PROJECTS`) and minimum-exchange filter to skip empty sessions.
- **Fact extraction quality/cost improvements**:
  - Trivial exchanges (bare slash commands, harness artifacts, short acknowledgements)
    are filtered before LLM calls.
  - Cross-batch duplicate facts within a session are dropped via normalized comparison.
  - Long sessions cap LLM calls (default 12, `MEMORY_BANK_MAX_EXTRACT_CALLS`) with
    evenly-spread batch selection so the whole session is represented.
  - Extraction prompt now prefers durable facts and problem→solution lessons.
- **Sync no longer re-copies archives compressed out-of-band**: `copyIfNewer` treats a
  current `.zst` copy as up-to-date, preventing full-history re-copy churn each session.

### Fixed
- **`read` MCP tool worked only on plain `.jsonl`**: reading any archived conversation
  failed with "File not found" once the archive was compressed. Now resolves `.zst`.
- **Summary coverage was misreported as zero**: existing `-summary.txt.zst` files are
  now detected by stats/analyze/sync/indexer/verify.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Multi coding-agent tagging**: Conversations and extracted facts now record which coding agent produced them.
  - Default source remains `claude-code`.
  - Additional sources can be configured with `MEMORY_BANK_AGENT_SOURCES` or `conversation-index/agent-sources.json`.
  - Supported agent labels include `claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`, and custom agent names.
- **Agent-aware search filters**: MCP and library search paths can filter conversations and facts by `coding_agent`.
  - `search` supports a `coding_agent` filter.
  - `search_facts` supports a `coding_agent` filter.
  - Search result formatting shows an agent tag for non-default sources.

### Changed
- **Sync now preserves source-agent identity**: Synced exchanges are tagged during indexing so multi-agent setups can share one memory bank without losing provenance.
- **Search agent upgraded to Sonnet**: The bundled `search-conversations` agent now uses Sonnet instead of Haiku for stronger retrieval and synthesis.
- **Plugin update docs clarified**: README update instructions now use the correct `/plugin update memory-bank` command.

### Fixed
- **Facts inherit coding-agent metadata**: Fact extraction now carries the exchange agent through to saved facts.
- **Search and fact schema migrations are backward-compatible**: Existing databases gain the new `coding_agent` columns through idempotent migrations.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **`/show-memory-bank` slash command**: Opens the Memory Bank web dashboard from Claude Code.
- **Automatic command installation**: SessionStart hooks install bundled slash commands into user scope.

### Changed
- **Plugin command manifest format**: `commands` now points to the commands directory so Claude Code can discover bundled commands correctly.

## [1.0.15] - 2025-12-17

### Changed
- **Stop shipping package-lock.json**: Removed from git tracking so npm generates platform-appropriate lockfile on install
- **Remove file deletion from MCP wrapper**: No longer deletes package-lock.json on first run (unnecessary without shipped lockfile)
