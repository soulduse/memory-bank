# Memory Bank

> Conversations → Knowledge Graph. Claude Code conversations become searchable, structured knowledge.

![Memory Bank](docs/memory-bank.gif)

## What's New in v1.2.0

- 🆕 **`analyzing-all-conversations` skill** — new plugin skill that analyzes and organizes your ENTIRE indexed conversation history into one report, and kicks off backfill for unanalyzed sessions
- 🆕 **`memory-bank analyze` command** — the deterministic engine behind the skill: coverage, per-project rollups, fact/domain breakdowns, monthly timeline, backfill recommendations
- 🆕 **Transparent `.jsonl.zst` archive support** — archives compressed out-of-band keep working across every read path (no extra dependency; requires Node >= 22.15 for built-in zstd)
- ⚡ **FTS5 text search** — BM25-ranked full-text search replaces the LIKE full scan (recall@10 0.93 → 1.00, FTS index 2.9GB → 407MB)
- ⚡ **Search-path performance** — cached DB connection, int8 vector quantization (dual-dtype), query-embedding memoization
- 🧹 **Fact extraction quality/cost controls** — trivial-exchange filtering, in-session dedup, strict confidence gating, per-session LLM call budget

## Features

- **Knowledge Graph** -- Ontology classification (Domain → Category) + typed relations (INFLUENCES, SUPPORTS, SUPERSEDES, CONTRADICTS)
- **RAG Search** -- Search results auto-enriched with related facts and ontology context
- **Conversation Search** -- Semantic vector search + FTS5 (BM25) full-text search across all past conversations
- **Full-History Analysis** -- `memory-bank analyze` + `analyzing-all-conversations` skill: coverage-checked report over the entire conversation *index* (projects, facts, domains, timeline, backfill gaps) — run `memory-bank sync` first so new conversations are indexed
- **Fact Extraction** -- Automatic extraction of decisions, preferences, patterns from conversations (trivial-exchange filtering, in-session dedup, confidence gating, LLM call budgeting)
- **Fact Consolidation** -- Duplicate detection, contradiction handling, evolution tracking
- **Graph Traversal** -- Multi-hop exploration (up to 3 hops) to trace decision chains
- **Cross-Project Insights** -- Find similar decisions from other projects
- **Fact Provenance** -- Trace any fact back to its source conversation
- **Scope Isolation** -- Project facts stay in their project, global facts are shared
- **Compressed Archive Support** -- Transparent `.jsonl.zst` reads across every path (parser, `read` tool, search, sync, stats, verify) using Node's built-in zstd (Node >= 22.15) — archives compressed out-of-band keep working
- **MCP Integration** -- 9 tools: `search`, `read`, `search_facts`, `search_ontology`, `ask_avatar`, `trace_fact`, `explore_graph`, `cross_project_insights`, `graph_stats`
- **3D Visualization** -- Interactive neon-style knowledge graph with data flow animation
- **Web UI** -- Dark-theme web interface for browsing and searching conversations

## How It Works

### Data Pipeline

```
▲ Prompt Input       User messages, tool calls, assistant responses
│                    → JSONL archiving → embedding (384-dim)
│
◎ User Scope         LLM extracts facts (decisions, preferences, patterns)
│                    → global facts shared across all projects
│
● Project Scope      Facts scoped per project, clustered by domain
│                    → cross-project insights available
│
◇ Ontology           Auto-classified into domains & categories
                     → typed relations: INFLUENCES / SUPPORTS / SUPERSEDES / CONTRADICTS
                     → multi-hop graph traversal (up to 3 hops)
```

## Install

In Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/jung-wan-kim/memory-bank
/plugin install memory-bank
```

## Update

```
/plugin update memory-bank
```

## Quick Start

```bash
memory-bank sync      # Sync & index conversations
memory-bank search "React auth"  # Semantic search
memory-bank stats     # Index statistics
memory-bank analyze   # Full-history analysis report (coverage, projects, facts)
```

## Full-History Analysis

`memory-bank analyze` aggregates the entire conversation **index** into one report — deterministic, read-only, no LLM calls. It reports on what has been indexed into SQLite: archive files that were never synced are not visible to it. The SessionStart hook syncs in the background, but that runs asynchronously — when freshness matters, run `memory-bank sync` (foreground) and let it finish before analyzing.

```bash
memory-bank analyze                    # Markdown report to stdout
memory-bank analyze --json             # Raw JSON for scripting
memory-bank analyze --top 30 --out ~/report.md   # Top 30 projects, saved to file
```

The report covers:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Coverage | Conversations (main sessions vs agent transcripts), sessions, exchanges, date range |
| Pipeline coverage | Fact extraction done/pending %, summary done/missing % |
| Facts | Active/inactive counts, by category, by scope |
| Knowledge domains | Top ontology domains by fact count |
| Projects | Per-project rollups: conversations, sessions, exchanges, facts, activity range |
| Timeline | Monthly session/exchange activity |
| Recommendations | Which backfills to run to close analysis gaps |

The **`analyzing-all-conversations` skill** builds on this: it runs the analysis, kicks off
backfill for unanalyzed sessions (`scripts/backfill-extract-worker.js` — lock-protected and
resumable), then enriches the numbers with fact/ontology search into an organized report.
Trigger it with requests like *"모든 대화 분석"*, *"analyze all my conversations"*.

## Fact System

Facts are automatically extracted at session end and consolidated at session start.

Extraction quality/cost controls (v1.2.0):
- Trivial exchanges (bare slash commands, harness artifacts, short acknowledgements) are filtered before any LLM call
- Duplicate facts within a session are dropped across batches (normalized comparison)
- Facts without a valid numeric confidence ≥ 0.7 are rejected
- Long sessions cap LLM calls with evenly-spread batch sampling (`MEMORY_BANK_MAX_EXTRACT_CALLS`, default 12)

| Category | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `decision` | "Using Riverpod for state management" |
| `preference` | "Named exports only" |
| `pattern` | "Bug-fixer retries 3 times on error" |
| `knowledge` | "API endpoints at /api/v2/" |
| `constraint` | "No localStorage usage" |

### Consolidation Rules

![Fact Lifecycle](docs/fact-lifecycle.svg)

| Relation | Action |
|----------|--------|
| DUPLICATE | Merge (count++) |
| CONTRADICTION | Replace old + revision history |
| EVOLUTION | Update + revision history |
| INDEPENDENT | Keep both |

### Scope Isolation

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Project A"
        FA1[Fact: Use Riverpod]
        FA2[Fact: Flutter arch]
    end
    subgraph "Project B"
        FB1[Fact: Use Redux]
        FB2[Fact: React arch]
    end
    subgraph "Global"
        FG1[Fact: Named exports]
        FG2[Fact: Korean responses]
    end

    FG1 -.->|shared| FA1
    FG1 -.->|shared| FB1
    FA1 x--x FB1
```

Project A sees: Project A facts + Global facts (never Project B).

## MCP Tools

```

## Skills

Installed automatically with the plugin:

| Skill | When it triggers | What it does |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| `remembering-conversations` | "how should I...", "last time we...", stuck on a problem | Dispatches the search agent over past conversations and returns synthesized findings |
| `analyzing-all-conversations` **(new in v1.2.0)** | "모든 대화 분석", "대화내역 정리", "analyze all conversations" | Runs `memory-bank analyze`, starts backfill for unanalyzed sessions, and produces an organized full-history report |

## Web UI

A cinematic dark-theme web interface for browsing and searching your conversation history.

![Web UI](docs/ui-projects.png)

### Features

- **Projects View** -- Browse all projects grouped by category, sorted by latest/most/A-Z
- **Search** -- Full-text search across all conversations
- **User Prompts** -- Browse and search only user messages
- **Exchange Detail** -- View full user/assistant messages with tool call history
- **Hue OS Publication** -- Q&A-only personal mirror chat backed by the personal mirror artifacts in `~/.codex/personal-mirror`

### Run

```bash
node ui/server.cjs
# Memory Bank UI: http://localhost:3847
# Hue OS: http://localhost:3847/hue-os
```

Custom port:
```bash
PORT=8080 node ui/server.cjs
```

> **Note:** Requires `memory-bank sync` to have been run at least once to populate the database.
> The Hue OS publication route (`/hue-os`, with `/replacement-os` kept as a compatibility alias) can still load from local Personal Mirror artifacts when the conversation database is unavailable.
> Chat defaults to local terminal CLIs instead of API keys: Claude via `claude --print --model sonnet`, GPT via `codex exec --model gpt-5.5`.
> Override with `REPLACEMENT_OS_CLAUDE_COMMAND`, `REPLACEMENT_OS_CLAUDE_ARGS_JSON`, `REPLACEMENT_OS_GPT_COMMAND`, or `REPLACEMENT_OS_GPT_ARGS_JSON`.
> If local terminal providers are unavailable, the route falls back to a deterministic safety-preserving response mode.
> Public sharing guardrails: `/hue-os` requires password login (`REPLACEMENT_OS_ACCESS_PASSWORD`, default `0525`; 4 digits auto-submit in the login UI) and limits each client IP to 200 chat requests per local day (`REPLACEMENT_OS_DAILY_LIMIT`, reset at 00:00). The chat UI hides provider selection, disables Send during responses, shows an in-chat loading bar while Hue OS answers, and uses Esc to cancel an in-flight answer.
> Hue OS answer boundary: it refuses access/security-sensitive questions, including passwords, tokens, cookies, env values, server/tunnel URLs, auth bypasses, quota bypasses, and security-weakening instructions.
> Vercel sharing bridge: `vercel/hue-os/` is a standalone Vercel project that proxies `/api/hue-os/*` to a public HTTPS tunnel for this local server. Vercel cannot call your private `localhost` directly; keep this server running and set `HUE_OS_LOCAL_ORIGIN` to the tunnel/reverse-proxy origin so Claude/Codex subscription CLI auth stays local.

## Claude Desktop Integration

Share Claude Code's memory with Claude Desktop by adding the MCP server:

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/memory-bank/cli/mcp-server-wrapper.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/memory-bank` with the actual plugin path (check `~/.claude/plugins/`).

Claude Desktop will then have access to all your Claude Code conversations and extracted facts via the same `search`, `read`, and `search_facts` tools.

## Configuration

```bash
# Fact extraction model (default: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)
export MEMORY_BANK_FACT_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key

# Summarization model
export MEMORY_BANK_API_MODEL=opus

# Fact extraction LLM call budget per session (default: 12, evenly-spread batches)
export MEMORY_BANK_MAX_EXTRACT_CALLS=12

# Decompression cap for .zst archives (bytes; lowering only, default 256 MiB)
export MEMORY_BANK_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES=268435456
```

## 3D Knowledge Graph

Interactive visualization of the full knowledge graph with neon-style nodes and data flow animation.

![Knowledge Graph](docs/graph-3d-screenshot.png)

```bash
open docs/graph-3d.html   # Interactive 3D graph (local)
```

4 layers: **Prompt Input** → **User Scope** → **Project Scope** → **Ontology**, with animated particles showing data flow direction.

```

## Cloud (private alpha, opt-in)

Local memory-bank is the default and is unaffected by cloud mode. A separate,
issuer-bound **private** cloud plane (Supabase-backed) is available as an opt-in
server — it is not auto-registered in the plugin and exposes no public tools.

```bash
# Server-only: never ship the service token to clients/browsers.
export MEMORY_BANK_CLOUD_SUPABASE_URL="https://<ref>.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_TOKEN="<service_role_key>"
memory-bank-cloud-mcp-server          # client profile (no issue_token)
memory-bank-cloud-mcp-server --admin  # control-plane profile (issue_token enabled)

# Sidecar spool → cloud sync:
memory-bank-cloud-sync status
memory-bank-cloud-sync doctor
memory-bank-cloud-sync push           # needs MEMORY_BANK_CLOUD_TOKEN or _SESSION_TOKEN
```

Deployment status and the remaining operator steps (project creation, `db push`,
RLS, smoke) are tracked in [`docs/memory-bank-cloud-deploy-runbook.md`](docs/memory-bank-cloud-deploy-runbook.md).
