 * once per project (up to `MAX_HAIKU_CALLS × projectCount` calls) and, for
 * INDEPENDENT/CONTRADICTION verdicts (new fact stays active), kept re-comparing
 * the same global fact every pass.
 *
 * Each fact is compared within its own scope: a project fact against its
 * project + global (via its scope_project), a global fact against the whole
 * store (scope_project is null → no scope filter). Because a fact merged away
 * by an earlier comparison is deactivated, it neither reappears in this list
 * nor as a later candidate.
