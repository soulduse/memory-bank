/**
 * Version drift guard — a plugin update must not leave old-version processes running.
 *
 * Incident (2026-07-14): a v1.3.3 sync-cli wedged for 23h kept the singleton lock,
 * silently starving every newer sync (indexing frozen), while the stale install
 * record kept spawning v1.3.3 into every new session after v1.4.3 shipped.
 *
 * Two enforcement points use this module:
 *  - sync-cli lock: the lock file carries {pid, version, startedAt} so a newer
 *    sync takes over from an older or wedged holder instead of skipping forever.
 *  - SessionStart sweep (scripts/version-drift-check.js): detached workers
 *    running from an older versioned plugin dir are terminated. MCP servers are
 *    never swept — killing one breaks a live session's tools; those only rotate
 *    on session restart.
