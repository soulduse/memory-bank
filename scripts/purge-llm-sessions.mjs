/**
 * One-time cleanup for exchanges indexed from LLM worker sessions BEFORE the
 * v1.3.3 exclusion (`isExcludedProject`) existed. v1.3.3 stops NEW pollution
 * (indexing/sync/verify all skip `*-memory-bank-llm` slugs) and keeps old rows
 * out of fact extraction — but rows indexed earlier remain in the exchanges
 * table, the FTS index, and the vec_exchanges vector index, actively polluting
 * both text and semantic search. This script removes them.
 *
 * TWO pollution families (both pre-v1.3.3 legacies):
 *   1. SLUG family (default): project slug ends with `-memory-bank-llm` —
 *      worker sessions after the fixed-workdir change but before indexing
 *      exclusion. Measured locally: 14,287 exchanges.
 *   2. LEGACY-PROMPT family (--legacy-prompts): worker sessions from BEFORE
 *      the fixed workdir existed — the Agent SDK query() ran with the CALLER
 *      project's cwd, so their transcripts were indexed under REAL project
 *      slugs and cannot be identified by slug at all. Identified instead by
 *      the exact leading text of the worker system prompts (versioned in
 *      src/). Measured locally: 59,940 exchanges (~16% of the corpus) across
 *      fact-extract / ontology-classify / relation-detect / consolidation.
 *
 * Safety model:
 *   - DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT: prints what would be deleted. Pass --apply to mutate.
 *   - BACKUP FIRST: on --apply, the polluted exchanges + tool_calls rows are
 *     copied into a timestamped sqlite file next to the index DB before any
 *     delete runs (verified row-for-row before the first delete). Embeddings
 *     are not backed up — regenerable from the exchange text.
 *   - Slug discriminator matches v1.3.3 isExcludedProject exactly (slug ending
 *     `-memory-bank-llm`). Prompt discriminators are exact multi-word template
 *     leads (≥49 chars) — a real human message starting with the verbatim
 *     template text is vanishingly rare, and the backup covers even that.
 *   - All deletes run in a single transaction; tool_calls are deleted
 *     explicitly (the FK is ON DELETE CASCADE but that only fires when
 *     PRAGMA foreign_keys is ON, which we don't assume).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/purge-llm-sessions.mjs                            # dry-run, slug family
 *   node scripts/purge-llm-sessions.mjs --apply                    # backup + delete, slug family
 *   node scripts/purge-llm-sessions.mjs --legacy-prompts           # dry-run, BOTH families
 *   node scripts/purge-llm-sessions.mjs --legacy-prompts --apply   # backup + delete, BOTH families
